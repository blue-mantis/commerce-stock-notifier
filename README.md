# Commerce Stock Notifier plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

Notifies a customizable set of email addresses when a Craft Commerce site is running low on stock.

Inspired by Pixel & Tonic's [CraftCMS 2 plugin](https://github.com/pixelandtonic/CommerceStockNotifier) of the same name, which was never ported to CraftCMS 3.
